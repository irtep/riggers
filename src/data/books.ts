                If you are Charred Axle rigger or a fan, you might know our teams name the Amorcitos. Its spanish (one of the most common languages in earth) and translated to english maybe like "dear ones", or something like that. We have been calling ourselves "Amorcitos" quite while now. It started when we were still living in earth, it used to be a name of our internet router and the name kind of sticked on us.

                But who are we? Or as I want to start the story from the beginning, I will tell you who were at that point, when the story started. I am Peter Reincman, sometimes called as Caped Pete, Pete or even Bonbon (only my wife calls me that). I was about 40 at the time that mission started. Medium height, balding north european looking man. I was a sergeant at Outreach's military forces. Specialized in combat vehicle driving.
                My wife Adriana was dazzlingly beautiful south american. I called her Amorcita, our son Mama and everyone else Lieutenant Reincman or just Adri. She was an excellent mechanic, engineer and strategist/tactician. And I should mention, that she cooks excellent peruvian dishes too. Well, I could write pages about her, but lets keep the story going. The third member of Amorcitos is our son, Axel, around 25 years old at that time. Vetenary. He has been an excellent help to the mission, while studying animals in Tarapor and the best gunner i've seen. Biologically speaking im not his father, as he is from ex-marriage of my wife, but that is just a minor detail. OK, now you know something about us, so let the story really begin.

                While we still were celebrating our victory in our rig, we got a call to our comms system from Controller Folg. "That was a hell of a battle. You will get a bonus for this. Lets meet out side the area, so i can sort this out. They will open the way out of the arena now and point you to your pit. Wait me there. Folg out."

                We had a short strategy meeting. We did not trust Folg a bit, but we felt, that we did not really have any other options as there were still many combat vehicles around. So if Folg would want to kill or rob us, he could do that anyways, so we decided to do what he told us. However, we didn't want to make this too easy for him, so we geared up some.

            We were wearing Outreach Mission Scouting kits (security level 1) (OMSK SL1) . Security level 1 was designed to medium risk enviroments, like uncharted world exploring, or maybe a bodyguarding of a VIP in low risk event. The OMSK SL1 contained: black leather outsdoor combat boots, light navy blue pants and long sleeved shirts, that had light protective plates in thighs, groin and breast (enough to stop most of light shell weapons and low energy beams). Addition to that black, light combat gloves, that had a good grip, made of same leatherlike feather weight fabric, that our suits, that resisted cuts and heat very well and steel reinforced knuckles. Weapons were in black leather belt. They were combat knife and heavy navy pistol (Seadragon Navy S), that fired high caliber, blunt bullets. Designed for maximum tissue damage, but minimum damage to spacecraft walls and other systems, that spacecrafts are full of.
            After a bit considerations, we upgraded our kits security level to two. That meant, that we put over our shirts breastplate sets and combat helmets with tactical visors.`

            The pit that was designed us was a zone, that had a corrugated iron shelter and a wall full of tools. There was also an rifle armed guardsman, probably to keep an eye of tools, that nobody stole them. After a short while the all-terrain roller we had won was towed to there too and then Controller Rolg appeared in heavily armed Boor.
            Me and Arle stepped out of the Bullterrier and looked mean. Annika took a driver seat and kept the engine running, in case we needed some firepower.

            He stepped out of his with some kind of laptop computer and two big bakkor bodyguards with nasty looking combat shotguns. He opened the laptop to work table in room and said. "Ok folks, first i need a name of your team." My head felt empty so I said same name that our car racing team in old earth had "Racing Team Amorcitos".
            "Heh, I like that. Very original." Said Folg and worked few minutes with his computer. "Alright, now I have your charred axle team registered and ranking points you earned credited. Also, your team has now an account of trade reputation and reputation you won today are credited there. I sent ID and keys to your rigs communications system. Also there are my details, if you want another match, you just contact me."
            I said "OK, thanks I guess. So we are done here?". "Just one thing", he said "There was a special news feed today, that says, that Outreach is destroyed. There was same kind of explosion, that in many other places around star system. I asked from Hukk too, were I work, but they don't know anything more than in official news feeds. Im sorry for your losses. Feel free to use these tools for repairs as long as you like, but don't steal anything. Good bye."
            Then he packed his laptop and left with his bodyguards with his noisy rig.

            First we checked local news feeds with our rigs comms and they said exactly what Folg told us. Luckily we had lots of work to do to fix our rigs, so we didn't have the think about all our friends, that were probably dead or missing. Our hot rod and our new all-terrain roller were designed to take damage and get fixed, so after few hours of work with pits tools, printers and metal plates we had those both in quite good condition and we were ready to continue our journey towards the N1 base, but due the bad news we got about Outreach and other explosions, we had a real bad feeling about this.                `

            We considered the pit area quite safe, so we decided to sleep there in our rigs. After day full of of adrenaline and devastating news we were so drained of energy, that I think we all slept very well. After the sun came up we waked up, ate breakfasts from our supplies and started to drive in rainy weathers towards N1's location. Arle drove the Bullterrier, Annika at gunners seat and I drove the all-terrain roller, that we named "Leprechaun" due its green point job."

It was a hand held console that scanned texts in different languages, translated them to english and then printed out stickers. So now leprechauns drivers console was full of stickers saying what which text said. It had no steering wheel, but too joystick to control each one of the tracks and weapons. I figured out quite fastly what does what, and what means what in digital console. I gotta confess, that those funny stickers from Annika helped a lot.

Planned at this stage for a crew of 20, that was suppose to research essence, climate, local animals and vegetation. It was about 500 x 500 meters area, in north and west it ended in very steep mountain range, other sides were surrounded by about 4 meter high, strong steel wire fence. Behind the fence there were automated sentry posts, that looked inactive. The perimeter fence seemed intact, but after that there was a sorry sight. East side of the base was pretty much completely destroyed, There was a huge, maybe 100 meter radius wide crater of a big explosion. It seems, that the explosion disintigrated the science station, comms and hq building and living barracks. Also, the mine entrance at south end of the mountains looked badly collapsed.
            The west side looked bit better. It seemed, that dome like, about 100x50m garage/workshop was almost intact, also behind two destroyed warehouses, there was still one warehouse and power station in quite good condition.

The biggest dog was white sturdy male dog, we named Pontus, then there was midsized brown that got name Queen and one yellowish brown, bit bigger than Queen, but probably its son, that got name Yaco. They must have been near the western fence to survive a blast that big. They seemed to be happy hungry, but other than that ok. We fed them and gave them water. What made our desperate job easier was, that we did not have to do any graveyard work, as it seems, that humans had been in work at that time in office, research labs or in living barracks.
            We found out, that the warehouse, that have been far away enough to survive the blast had some weaponry, spare parts and food rations. Lucky us. Power plant seemed to have about every fuse broken, along with some other parts, but with fuses, spareparts and some engineering magic from Annika, we were able to restore the power of the base. The base meaning now the garage/workshop and automated perimeter defences.

It had a big enough gate to drive most of the vehicles through, inside the there was a well equipped workshop, that had about everything you would need for mining operations and surviving. in the center, there was a wide ramp, that continued gently to downwards to garage part. In garage part we found everything you can dream of to maintenance and fix rigs. But not only that, we found two rigs. One was Bakkor Miner, probably meant for mining operations and one Desert Spear, probably meant for fast travelling around Nii'vaat.

            We analized our situation. First where do we want to be? We figured out, that this was the best place to be right now for us. If ever The crew of Outreach would try to find us (or anyone else from the Outreach), they would try to do it from here. Also we had good amount of supplies and machines at disponible and security was probably better, except, maybe at starports.

            However, starports would be good option as well. As by now the martial law has been terminated, we would be probably free to move out and inside from those. Our security situation at N1 was quite fine. Perimeter was protected by mountains in north and east and fence and sentry towers in other side. It worked so, that if somebody climbed or broke the steel wired wall, sentry towers would fire them. They had double blasters, that were set to extra high energy input, so they hit equally as primed twin-blasters of a charred axle rig. If some raider team had power to overcome that, we had also 4 rigs (however only 3 drivers), that we could ride to combat those raiders. So, while we all were at the base, we were protected against some raider bands, but we knew, that in Nii'vaat are some bigger organizations, that could outgun as, and quite easily too.   
            So if we stayed, the one thing we needed is to upgrade the security of the base.

            We had pretty good supply of trade reputation as we just one some in charred axle, and we had bases, quite good trade reputation in our hands. We thought, that nobody probably will ever ask us, what we did with that money, and if they did, that would be just a happy day anyways, as there would be some organized Outreach administration again. Also, we were sure, that it would be understandable, that we used those to survive and care the base.

            But anyways, those trade reputations would run eventually out, and we just did not want to be here twiddling our thumbs. We decided, that we would try to be charred axle professionals. We had a good military training, 4 rigs, and excellent workshop. The workshop had fine intermoon communication systems, so we contacted Controller Folg, and said that we would like to participate again in some event. Also, as we had only one rig with crystalline cocoon, we ordered 3 more cocoons, to add them to Bullterrier, miner that we christened to Amazonas and to desert spear, that we christened to Dragon Slayer.

            Our custom All-terrain roller had three engines, one for each "wheel", located just outside our protective cocoon and one at the bottom of the rig, that would take over the job, if one or both of those motors would break up. We had modificated a lot the controls. We had replaced original taraporian consoles with human consoles, that we made in our workshop.
            Also, we switched the original joystick based driving and fire controls to driving wheel, that i was better accustomed to. We switched the drivers seat bit left and installed gunners seat and console next to it. I would drive and Arle would be a gunner. Annika would be the tank leader, but she would
            direct us outside the arena, watching from live stream and communicating with us in open crypted radio channel. We had armed the Leprechaun with class 9 armour plates, heavy variant rattler, double micro rocket pod and Arle would control a monoroller combat familiar, that had mawler appendages and some extra armour. We were able to boost its armour to class 9, so it was a tough nut to chew.

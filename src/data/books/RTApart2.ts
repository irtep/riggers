                While we still were celebrating our victory in our rig, we got a call to our comms system from Controller Folg. "That was a hell of a battle. You will get a bonus for this. Lets meet out side the area, so i can sort this out. They will open the way out of the arena now and point you to your pit. Wait me there. Folg out."

                We had a short strategy meeting. We did not trust Folg a bit, but we felt, that we did not really have any other options as there were still many combat vehicles around. So if Folg would want to kill or rob us, he could do that anyways, so we decided to do what he told us. However, we didn't want to make this too easy for him, so we geared up some.

            We were wearing Outreach Mission Scouting kits (security level 1) (OMSK SL1) . Security level 1 was designed to medium risk enviroments, like uncharted world exploring, or maybe a bodyguarding of a VIP in low risk event. The OMSK SL1 contained: black leather outsdoor combat boots, light navy blue pants and long sleeved shirts, that had light protective plates in thighs, groin and breast (enough to stop most of light shell weapons and low energy beams). Addition to that black, light combat gloves, that had a good grip, made of same leatherlike feather weight fabric, that our suits, that resisted cuts and heat very well and steel reinforced knuckles. Weapons were in black leather belt. They were combat knife and heavy navy pistol (Seadragon Navy S), that fired high caliber, blunt bullets. Designed for maximum tissue damage, but minimum damage to spacecraft walls and other systems, that spacecrafts are full of.
            After a bit considerations, we upgraded our kits security level to two. That meant, that we put over our shirts breastplate sets and combat helmets with tactical visors.`

            The pit that was designed us was a zone, that had a corrugated iron shelter and a wall full of tools. There was also an rifle armed guardsman, probably to keep an eye of tools, that nobody stole them. After a short while the all-terrain roller we had won was towed to there too and then Controller Rolg appeared in heavily armed Boor.
            Me and Arle stepped out of the Bullterrier and looked mean. Annika took a driver seat and kept the engine running, in case we needed some firepower.

            He stepped out of his with some kind of laptop computer and two big bakkor bodyguards with nasty looking combat shotguns. He opened the laptop to work table in room and said. "Ok folks, first i need a name of your team." My head felt empty so I said same name that our car racing team in old earth had "Racing Team Amorcitos".
            "Heh, I like that. Very original." Said Folg and worked few minutes with his computer. "Alright, now I have your charred axle team registered and ranking points you earned credited. Also, your team has now an account of trade reputation and reputation you won today are credited there. I sent ID and keys to your rigs communications system. Also there are my details, if you want another match, you just contact me."
            I said "OK, thanks I guess. So we are done here?". "Just one thing", he said "There was a special news feed today, that says, that Outreach is destroyed. There was same kind of explosion, that in many other places around star system. I asked from Hukk too, were I work, but they don't know anything more than in official news feeds. Im sorry for your losses. Feel free to use these tools for repairs as long as you like, but don't steal anything. Good bye."
            Then he packed his laptop and left with his bodyguards with his noisy rig.

            First we checked local news feeds with our rigs comms and they said exactly what Folg told us. Luckily we had lots of work to do to fix our rigs, so we didn't have the think about all our friends, that were probably dead or missing. Our hot rod and our new all-terrain roller were designed to take damage and get fixed, so after few hours of work with pits tools, printers and metal plates we had those both in quite good condition and we were ready to continue our journey towards the N1 base, but due the bad news we got about Outreach and other explosions, we had a real bad feeling about this.                `

            We considered the pit area quite safe, so we decided to sleep there in our rigs. After day full of of adrenaline and devastating news we were so drained of energy, that I think we all slept very well. After the sun came up we waked up, ate breakfasts from our supplies and started to drive in rainy weathers towards N1's location. Arle drove the Bullterrier, Annika at gunners seat and I drove the all-terrain roller, that we named "Leprechaun" due its green point job."

It was a hand held console that scanned texts in different languages, translated them to english and then printed out stickers. So now leprechauns drivers console was full of stickers saying what which text said. It had no steering wheel, but too joystick to control each one of the tracks and weapons. I figured out quite fastly what does what, and what means what in digital console. I gotta confess, that those funny stickers from Annika helped a lot.

            strings: `After few hours drive, we finally saw our destination, or what it was left of it. The N1 base was a relatively small science base. Planned at this stage for a crew of 20, that was suppose to research essence, climate, local animals and vegetation. It was about 500 x 500 meters area, in north and west it ended in very steep mountain range, other sides were surrounded by about 4 meter high, strong steel wire fence. Behind the fence there were automated sentry posts, that looked inactive. The perimeter fence seemed intact, but after that there was a sorry sight. East side of the base was pretty much completely destroyed, There was a huge, maybe 100 meter radius wide crater of a big explosion. It seems, that the explosion disintigrated the science station, comms and hq building and living barracks. Also, the mine entrance at south end of the mountains looked badly collapsed.
            The west side looked bit better. It seemed, that dome like, about 100x50m garage/workshop was almost intact, also behind two destroyed warehouses, there was still one warehouse and power station in quite good condition.

                If you are Charred Axle rigger or a fan, you might know our teams name the Amorcitos. Its spanish (one of the most common languages in earth) and translated to english maybe like "dear ones", or something like that. We have been calling ourselves "Amorcitos" quite while now. It started when we were still living in earth, it used to be a name of our internet router and the name kind of sticked on us.

                But who are we? Or as I want to start the story from the beginning, I will tell you who were at that point, when the story started. I am Peter Reincman, sometimes called as Caped Pete, Pete or even Bonbon (only my wife calls me that). I was about 40 at the time that mission started (not calculating years in Suspended Animation in Outreach). Medium height, balding north european looking man. I was a sergeant at Outreach's military forces. Specialized in combat vehicle driving.
                My wife Annika was dazzlingly beautiful south american. I called her Amorcita, our son Mama and everyone else Lieutenant Reincman or Adri. She was an excellent mechanic, engineer and strategist/tactician. And I should mention, that she cooks excellent peruvian dishes too. Well, I could write pages about her, but lets keep the story going. The third member of Amorcitos is our son, Corporal Arle Reincman, around 20 years old at that time. Vetenary. He has been an excellent help to the mission, while studying animals in Tarapor and the best gunner i've seen. Also as unit we three formed a solid combat vehicle crew.
                OK, now you know something about us, so let the story really begin.

                After about 17 years having based on Outreach, Arle got a transfer to Nii'vaat. There was a small human colony, that had a need of a veterinary and Arle was sent. As parents, we were asked if we wanted to escort him there, and of course we accepted.
                We got one of the cutter class shuttles, good storage of equipment and one of the rover vehicles, that was called Hot Rod's as they looked like some classic old earth hot rod car. We named the hot rod as Bullterrier, as its paint work, white, with red in front and blue and cyan back, slightly maybe resembled that kind of dog.

            'Weird, all systems seem to work in our end... i run analyze just in case. Could you contact the N1 base and ask what is going on?'. N1 was the base we were suppose to make our landing. It was a human controlled starport and research station at Nii'vaat, were Arle was suppose to start his work.

            The Grey Sky station was quite big spaceport, that Union had in Nii'vaat. It was a busy port with few thousand persons living and working there. Architecht was mostly domes or dome like structures to counter local weather phenoms. We arrived at I guess you could say in summerlike season as the weather was bit hot, windy and cloudy.
            We were about a week at the station waiting news or orders from human colonies, but we did not get any. There was lots of Union's Military movement at the port, mostly Union's units coming in and leaving to some direction. There was even rumours, that one of the Keepers have been seen around, but we could not confirm if that was true or not. Also officers had their mounths shut, but something big was clearly going on.

            One evening after practice, when we were eating at restaurant owned by a human family we got approached by well dressed ainashian.
            He had a sophisticated translation device near his collar, that could almost silence his natural voice output, translate that and output pretty much perfect english.

            We talked a quite a bit. Mostly about our combat skills and experience and about what is Hukk Industries and what it does. The thing was, that as we had a formidable looking rig in our disposal, he needed us to take him to Hukk site, that he has lost contact to and the carrot to us was, that he said, that he would be able to get us permission to travel outside the spaceport, so we had a change to go take a look what happened to N1 colony. Also, as a sugar on top, he offered us quite generous sum of trade reputation, that was welcomed addition, as we indeed were running out of our trade reputations.

            Controller Folg adviced us to prepare for worst, so we armed Bullterrier pretty heavily. It had class 9 armour plates, light blasters, microbeams and big shatterblast missile launcher with turning turret. Also we had mine launcher with potent thermite mines and static haze projector mines. Annika also installed a turbo charger, that gave lots of extra power to motor, but made it harder to handle. However, that was no problem to me, I liked to drift in corners, so we considered that just a good thing.

            The weather was bit rainy, that was considered here a good weather. After being that long time trapped in that starport and before that in the cutter, we were all in good moods to have something else to do and the journey went well and fast in highways of Nii'vaat.

            Second day of travelling, we were suppose to be pretty close to the destination. However, after a curve we came to a valley, that seemed to have some kind of huge metal transporter trains blocking the way and we saw same kind of trains moving to block our way back too...

            What happens now, is that you will be challenged to a charred axle match. I know you are military and you know what you are doing, but do not take this lightly. You will get very formidable opponent and stakes are very high. If you lose, you probably get killed, as your rig does not have the protective cocoon, but in the best case, the winner takes your rig, or whatever is left of that. If you win, you get the rig of the opponent or what is left of that, very generous compansation in trade credits and you can go where you want. Also, as you have probably figured out, this is not exactly legal charred axle event, but I make sure to give you official ranking points, if you can pull a win here. But make no mistake, you are a serious underdog here.'

            This was starting to be too much here to bear... Uncertainess of Outreach and N1 destination, frustrating wait and now this... atmosphere was getting heated. I think Folg noticed this and this was the first time we saw them showing some emotions. They said 'Hey! What the hell you expected? This is not some sugar coated luxury ship you float in space, pretending you are better than rest and everything is flowers and laugh! You came Nii'vaat and this is how Nii'vaat works! Rules are different here. If you are stupid, you get get treated like a stupid. You fight or die. You win and get rich or you lose and you fucking die!'

            That was maybe the best prep talk i've ever had. I watched my son and wife and I asked 'You OK with this?'. they nodded at me. 'OK you asshole. Who do we fight?'. Folg grinned and said 'You fight a person named Desert Lord'.

            We got a briefing how this works out. We would get a signal, and then we and our opponent had about 15 seconds time to drive anywhere we want, any form of attacks were prohibited in this phase. After that we got signal "weapons free" and then, its basicly free for all.
            We got about three minutes time to "char" the opponent, that means that we should disable it or make it surrender (however is it not known if any rigger has ever surrendered.)
            If time goes out and more than one rig is still functioning, there will be calculated which "entertained the crowd better" and that crew will win. It waries about the event, but in this place they had some kind of AI monitoring "favouring acts", that included attacking with weapons, making damage and evading attacks. To add some spicy to the pot, there were three "primer pads", that would be randomly enabled that let you supercharge your weapons. Annika took a look, and our weapons should be able to use that super charge, after all, they are Hukk Industry weapons, that Outreach has bought earlier.

Speed should be about the same as our,but handling bit better than ours, as it had computer assisted steering system, however I hoped that my drifting skills would compensate that difference. Lots of decoy flares, damn. Double micro rocket pods, heavy beam cannon (Convergenge Beam Cannon). Also Arle was able to find out from the local internet-kind of place, that this Desert Lord was known for his incredible driving skills, especially when evading attacks. This was not going to be easy.

If he gets away, we look for cover behind those trees, or those rocks. Arle, I want to see absolutely always, when in range missiles flying at him, as we need points.

Arle fired a rocket, that barely missed, but evading that cost all his momentum and he decided turn a bit and put up a reverse gear... to get a good angle fire and finish us with that powerful energy cannon... but BANG! hit by a thermite mine and when we saw in our tactical display text CHARRED next to "Dark Lord" we screamed like madmen!
